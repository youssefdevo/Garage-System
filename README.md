## About the Project

The Garage System is designed to manage parking operations efficiently. It incorporates advanced software design concepts to achieve a flexible and modular structure. The project is ideal for developers looking to understand the practical application of SOLID principles and various design patterns.

## Features

- **Vehicle Management:** Add, update, and manage vehicles in the system.
- **Slot Allocation:** Dynamically allocate parking slots based on availability.
- **Fee Calculation:** Compute parking fees based on time and rates.
- **Report Generation:** Generate detailed reports on parking usage.
- **User-Friendly Design:** Intuitive and simple system interface.

## Design Principles and Patterns

### SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Ensures each class has a single responsibility.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Makes the system open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subtypes can replace their base types without altering the correctness of the system.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Promotes specific, client-focused interfaces.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules but on abstractions.

### Design Patterns

- **Factory Pattern:** Used for object creation without specifying the exact class.
- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures a single instance of a class.
- **Strategy Pattern:** Enables runtime selection of algorithms.
- **Observer Pattern:** Implements a subscription mechanism for notifying multiple objects.
- **Decorator Pattern:** Adds behavior to objects dynamically.
